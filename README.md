## Here's me learning how to use github
So far I have found using github **confusing**. I think I now understand how branches work, but I'm not sure how to make branches and commits from my terminal and how the review process works.
I need to start using github more so that:
- my projects are organised better
- I can share what I'm doing with prospective employers
- I slot into a developer team better when I start working
